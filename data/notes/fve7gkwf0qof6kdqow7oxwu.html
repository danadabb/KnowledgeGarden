<p>Notes on PIXI JS</p>
<ul>
<li>A Container is the most basic class you have. It has no graphical representation but it's used to group objects as a unit</li>
<li>A Sprite is the simplest way to show a bitmap on your screen.</li>
<li>Sprites can show graphics and Containers are used to group sprites to move, rotate and scale them as a whole.</li>
<li>You can add containers to other containers.</li>
<li>The root of everything is the Stage. The stage is the regular container the application class creates and feeds to the Renderer to render</li>
<li>Anything shown on the screen must inherit from the abstract class <code>DisplayObject</code> e.g. Sprite, Container all inherit from this class</li>
<li>A DisplayObject can only have one parent</li>
<li>A Particle Container is a special kind of container designed to go fast.</li>
<li>Graphics allows you to make primitive drawings like rectangles, circles and lines. It's useful for simple graphics without a bitmap file.</li>
<li>Ticker is an object that will call a function every frame before rendering</li>
