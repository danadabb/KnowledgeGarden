Notes from the book (https://basecamp.com/shapeup) outlining the Shape Up methodology

## Introduction

Shape up at a high level:

- Work in **six-week cycles**
- Shape up the work before giving it to a team. A senior group defines the key elements of the solution before it's considered ready to bet on. The solution should be concrete enough so that teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves
- Give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and developers. Seniors spend less time managing teams as they autonomously work to define their own tasks, make adjustments to scope and work to build vertical slices.

### Principles of Shaping

- Shape up work at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete.
- Wireframes are too concrete
- Words are too abstract - projects defined in too few words are not clear

#### Steps to Shaping

1. Set boundaries - figure out how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem
2. Rough out the elements - sketch a solution at a higher level of abstraction than Wireframes
3. Address risks and rabbit holes - amend the solution, cut things out of it or specify details at certain spots
4. Write the pitch - Once it's ready to bet on, we package it in a formal write-up called a "pitch". The pitch summarizes the problems, constraints, solution, rabbit holes and limitations.

### Set Boundaries

- Setting the appetite - this is the time budget for a standard team size. It can be either a Small batch which means its something that can be built in 1-2 weeks, or a Big Batch which takes a full six-weeks. This is assuming the team is one designer and 1-2 programmers.
- Fixed time, variable scope - an appetite and estimate aren't the same. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. Fixed time, variable scope, means to decide what is core to the project and what is peripheral or unnecessary.
- Good is relative - there is no "best" solution. The amount of time we set for our appetite is going to lead us to different solutions.
- Responding to raw ideas - when we get new ideas, it's too early to commit and put into backlog. We need to give it space to learn whether it's important or what it might entail.
- Narrow down the problem - flip from asking "what could we build?" to "What's really going wrong?". We need to narrow down the problem so that a complex request is not taken at face value.

Watch out for grab bags - unclear ideas like "redesign" or "refactorings" that aren't driven by a single problem or use case.

### Finding the Elements

#### Move at the right speed

1. Either we work alone or with a trusted partner who can keep pace with us
2. Avoid the wrong level of detail in the drawings and sketches

Work by hand using a couple of prototyping techniques: breadboarding and fat marker stretches:

**Breadboarding** - a breadboard is an electrical engineering prototype that has all the components and wiring of a real device. There are three basic things we draw:

1. Places: things we can navigate to like screens, dialogues or menus that pop up
2. Affordances: things the user can act on like buttons and fields and copies.
3. Connection lines: show how the affordances take the user from place to place

We do the above with words instead of pictures. For example, breadboarding customers turning off auto pay:

**Fat marker sketches** - A sketch made with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or impossible. You can do this with a larger tipped sharpie pen on paper or an iPad with a pen size at the largest diameter. Because ideas are sometimes visual, breadboarding would miss the point.
