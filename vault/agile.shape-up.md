Notes from the book (https://basecamp.com/shapeup) outlining the Shape Up methodology

## Introduction

Shape up at a high level:

- Work in **six-week cycles**
- Shape up the work before giving it to a team. A senior group defines the key elements of the solution before it's considered ready to bet on. The solution should be concrete enough so that teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves
- Give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and developers. Seniors spend less time managing teams as they autonomously work to define their own tasks, make adjustments to scope and work to build vertical slices.

### Principles of Shaping

- Shape up work at the right level of abstraction: not too vague and not too concrete.
- Wireframes are too concrete
- Words are too abstract - projects defined in too few words are not clear

#### Steps to Shaping

1. Set boundaries - figure out how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem
2. Rough out the elements - sketch a solution at a higher level of abstraction than Wireframes
3. Address risks and rabbit holes - amend the solution, cut things out of it or specify details at certain spots
4. Write the pitch - Once it's ready to bet on, we package it in a formal write-up called a "pitch". The pitch summarizes the problems, constainrs, solution, rabbit holes and limitations.
