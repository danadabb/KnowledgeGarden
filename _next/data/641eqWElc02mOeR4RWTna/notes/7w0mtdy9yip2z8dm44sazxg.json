On the command side, CQRS emphasizes the use of commands to perform action that modify application state. The traditional alternative to CQRS is CRUD (create, read, update delete) where the same services are responsible for the handling of all operations.</p>\n<p>On the query side, CQRS emphasizes the use of queries to retrieve data from the system. These are typically handled by query handlers within the system.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of separating command and query is giving developers the ability to optimize each side independently. Read can be optimized with strategies such as caching or specialized data stores. CQRS is useful in complex domains or applications where read and write have different scalability and performance requests. Considering it adds complexity would mean that it's not suitable for all requirements and trade-offs should be taken into account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/KnowledgeGarden/notes/x9svkv1c2vvyef4l5xjdmps\">Read more</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"acid--cap-theorem\">ACID &#x26; CAP Theorem<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#acid--cap-theorem\"></a></h3>\n<p>ACID (Atomic, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) are concepts in distributed systems that are used to explain the trade offs between consistency and availability.</p>\n<p>According to the CAP theorem, any distributed system can only guarantee two of three properties at a time.
